# Project To-Do List

## Tasks

- [ ] Create streaming for output: have the text output streamed from the chatgpt endpoint. must continue to support code syntax highlighting
- [ ] Chat to decision: Make a simple chat interface that takes your input and does a single command based on the input. This is extensible and will work with future commands
- [ ] VSCode Extension: Make a vscode extension to see the currently focused tab and pipe the data to the cli that way the cli can see what tab is focused and you don't have to type the path. The trickiest part of this is actually just figuring out how to share state between vscode and the cli runtime. 
- [ ] Minor Bug -- Syntax highlighting: Fix syntax highlighting for nested / multiple sets of backticks
