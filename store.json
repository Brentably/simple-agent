I need to ask for it.\n  Action: ask_question(\"What is your name?\")\n  Result: Brent\n  Thought: The users name is Brent\n  Action: finish(\"Brent\")\n\n\n  Input: hey\n  Thought: The user has greeted me. I should respond with a greeting as well.\n  Action: ask_question(\"Hello! How can I assist you today?\")\n  Result: Write a simple function for me\n  Thought: The user wants me to write a function. I need to ask for more details about the function.\n  Action: ask_question(\"Sure! What should the function do? Can you provide more details?\")\n  Result: Yeah, it should just be a javascript function called hello that returns \"world\"\n  Thought: The user wants a simple JavaScript function that returns \"world\". I can create a function that does that.\n  Action: finish(\n  ```\n  const hello = () => {\n    return \"world\"\n  };\n  ``` \n  )\n\n\nRemember: Prefix your outputs with Thought or Action to signify what you're doing.\nLet me reiterate: Always invoke a function as part of your output. \n"
